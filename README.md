# Myst
Myst is an accountless, temporary, and web-based encrypted messaging application (https://myst.chat).

Myst is built using the Django web framework, and this repo contains the Django app files for Myst. I 
built this project to learn cryptography in js and python, so please do not use Myst for sensitive 
information unless you have verified for yourself that my implementation of end-to-end encryption is 
secure. If you identify a security vulnerablity, let me know following the steps outlined in `SECURITY.md`.
If you have any questions, feel free to email me at dev@myst.chat.
